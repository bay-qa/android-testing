# Espresso steps
## 1. Configure Espresso dependencies
* Add repository and dependencies as described on
 https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/setup.html
 https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/testing-support-library/packages.html
* Force versions used in the app with `resolutionStrategy`
See:
 https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Resolving-conflicts-between-main-and-test-APK
 https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html

* Define and use separate `espresso` build type based on debug (`testBuildType`, `buildTypes`)
* Switch to `espresso` build variant

## 2. Basic Espresso test
* Implement basic test with @RunWith, @Test, ActivityTestRule, basic actions and checks

## 3. Use string from resources
* Instrumented tests have access to AUT resources and objects
* InstrumentationRegistry has two similarly named methods:
  - getTargetContext() - returns the AUT context - use it operate on the app and its resources
  - getContext() - return the context of instrumentation package - use it access resources in test APK

## 4. Refactor duplicate code and introduce back button
* Move commonly used code to methods to avoid copy-paste and ease maintanance
* Caveats with Espress.pressBack():
  * Close soft keyboard before clicking it to make sure back button click is applied to an activity or fragment
  * Back button click on main activity will throw an exception (and AUT may be terminated at this time)

## 5. Introduce pressKey with complex keys
* Show that pressKey can be used both with simple keycode (KEYCODE_*) and complex keys via EspressKey.Builder class

## *. Access objects from the app
* Accessing objects from the app can be useful to reset AUT state

## *. Testcases for practice

===== Day 2
## 1. onData to select interests at the end of the list
* onData allows to select interests at the end of the list without failure
(ex. Football and Astronomy will failure with old implementation)

## 2. [Big] Espresso test with RecycleView, accessing app data, and complex matchers
* test data as final fields (some fields will be used in tests later)
* use build variants to use different files in normal run and under test
* launch the app from the beginning (SplashActivity)
 - Espresso won't do anything while animations are playing. But you will get an expection if
 animations are too long.
* private methods for more readable tests
* In previous commit we used onData to operate on lists. But unfortunately onData only works with
AdapterViews only and RecycleView is not an AdapterView.
Instead we should use RecyclerViewActions from espresso-contrib that has useful methods for working
 with RecycleViews. We use scrollTo(Matcher<View> itemViewMatcher) here.

## 3. Advanced interaction with AdapterView & custom Matcher
onData can be used with complex classes:
* implement custom matcher by inheriting it from BoundedMatcher. BounderMatcher already implements
checking for type of an object, so we can use matchesSafely(TypeWeInterestedIn) instead of matches(Object)
* use inAdapterView to make Espresso check one specific AdapterView
* use onChildView to work with specific child of the matched item view

===== Day 3
## 1. Verifying fired intent
Espresso Intents is important to isolate tests per activity. It allows to both verify that
 expected intents was fired when leaving activity and verify AUT response to receiving an intent
Documentation - https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/intents.html
Advanced usage not covered here - https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testing/blob/master/ui/espresso/IntentsAdvancedSample/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/android/testing/espresso/intents/AdvancedSample/ImageViewerActivityTest.java
* Replace ActivityTestRule with IntentsTestRule to enable Espresso Intents
* Use `intended` to verify fired intent
* Espress Intents has its own set of matchers to use against intents

## 2. Simulating receiving an intent
Use `intending` to stub response from other activities (launched with `startActivityForResult`)
 or to test AUT response to receiving an intent from another app

## 3. Sign Up tests implemented with Page Object pattern

# Android Testing

This project is a fake Android app that is intended to be used in workshop training to learn Android testing practices.

The Android app is based on the concept of a personal financial tracking/analysis app.  The app supports the following user journeys:

 * Login
 * Signup - personal info, selecting personal interests, and selecting credentials
 * Accounts Overview - Shows transaction lists for each of your credit cards
 * Linked Accounts - Shows a list of all bank accounts you've linked to the app
 * Link Account - Links a bank account to the app (that account will then appear in the accounts overview)
 * Credit Cards - Shows aggregate credit information across all of your linked cards
 * Analysis - Shows the amount you spend per category across all of your linked cards

The project comes with a number of pre-written tests.  These tests are mostly Espresso integration tests, but some unit tests are included as well.
